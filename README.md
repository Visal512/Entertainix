# Entertainix

Entertainix is an open source project that I have created which gets data from the TMDB API and displays them in a stylistic way, regarding the UI, which can be accessible to the client and shows them the many ins and outs of their favourite film or TV show. Entertainix has the following features:

- See the top 60 trending movies and TV shows
- Discover movies and TV shows and filter through them by genre
- Find the top rated TV shows and filter through them by genre
- Search for movies and TV shows
- See more information regarding all movies and TV shows including:
  - Certification
  - Type of content
  - Year
  - Runtime / Number of seasons
  - Genres
  - Director(s) / Creator(s)
  - Release Date / First and/or Last Episode Date
  - Cast and information about the cast, which includes, name, biography, details and all movies and TV shows they have been in

The packages used by the project are as follows:

- ReactJS + Vite (for development) : `$ npm create vite@latest <<YOUR-APP-NAME>> -- --template react`
- React Router DOM : `$ npm install react-router-dom`
- Axios : `$ npm install axios`
- Bootstrap : `$ npm install bootstrap`
- Material UI and Material UI Icon : `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material`
